## Assessment Details

### Target Application
- **Application**: OWASP Juice Shop (Intentionally Vulnerable Web Application)
- **Environment**: Docker container running locally on Kali Linux VM
- **Assessment Type**: Automated scanning with manual validation using multiple tools

### Tools & Environment
- **OS**: Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)
- **Target Deployment**: Docker container (local)
- **Primary Scanner**: OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
- **Secondary Scanner**: Nikto
- **Framework**: OWASP Top 10 (2021)

## Key Findings

### Critical Vulnerabilities Identified

| Vulnerability | OWASP Top 10 Category | Risk Level | Impact |
|--------------|----------------------|------------|---------|
| Broken Access Control | A01: Broken Access Control | **High** | Full admin access & data compromise |
| SQL Injection | A03: Injection | Medium | Database exposure potential |
| Outdated JavaScript Library | A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components | Medium | Exploitable component vulnerabilities |

### Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

#### 1. Broken Access Control (High Risk)
- **Location**: Login authentication system
- **Exploit**: SQL injection bypass using `' OR 1=1--`
- **Impact**: Complete administrative access and privilege escalation
- **Evidence**: Successfully accessed administrator profile through authentication bypass
- **Remediation**: 
  - Implement parameterized queries
  - Enforce input validation
  - Apply least privilege to database accounts

#### 2. SQL Injection (Medium Risk)
- **Location**: Login form fields
- **Issue**: Inadequate input sanitization allowing database manipulation
- **Impact**: Potential database exposure and unauthorized access
- **Remediation**: 
  - Use parameterized queries
  - Validate and sanitize all user input
  - Deploy web application firewall

#### 3. Outdated JavaScript Library (Medium Risk)
- **Detection**: Identified through OWASP ZAP reconnaissance
- **Issue**: Legacy JavaScript libraries with known vulnerabilities
- **Impact**: Exploitable components that threat actors can leverage
- **Remediation**: 
  - Use dependency scanners
  - Keep libraries updated
  - Remove unused dependencies

## Methodology

1. **Environment Setup**: 
   - Deployed OWASP Juice Shop in Docker container on Kali Linux VM
   - Configured isolated testing environment for safe vulnerability assessment

2. **Reconnaissance Phase**:
   - **Nikto**: Performed web server reconnaissance and exposed leaked files/directories
   - **OWASP ZAP**: Conducted comprehensive application scanning

3. **Active Scanning**:
   - OWASP ZAP identified input fields, user interactions, and potential vulnerabilities
   - Manual validation of automated findings through targeted testing

4. **Vulnerability Analysis**:
   - Mapped findings to OWASP Top 10 (2021) framework
   - Documented evidence with screenshots and detailed impact assessment

5. **Documentation**: Provided comprehensive remediation strategies for each vulnerability

## Educational Value

This assessment demonstrates:
- Multi-tool vulnerability assessment approach (OWASP ZAP + Nikto)
- Docker containerization for secure testing environments
- Practical application of ethical hacking methodologies
- Proper vulnerability classification and risk assessment
- Professional security documentation with visual evidence
- Understanding of OWASP Top 10 framework application

## Repository Contents

- **Nikto**: Web server reconnaissance, directory enumeration
- **Kali Linux**: Security-focused operating system utilization

## Disclaimer

This security assessment was conducted on the OWASP Juice Shop, which is an intentionally vulnerable application designed for educational and training purposes. The vulnerabilities identified are expected and part of the application's design to teach security concepts.

**Important**: The techniques and findings documented here should only be used for:
- Educational purposes
- Authorized security testing
- Improving security awareness
- Professional development in cybersecurity

Unauthorized use of these techniques against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Web application security testing
- Multi-tool vulnerability assessment
- Docker containerization for security testing
- Manual vulnerability validation
- Risk assessment and prioritization
- Professional security documentation with evidence
- OWASP framework application
- Ethical hacking methodologies

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future assessments:
